<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence.Thanks to deep learning, AI has a bright future. Indeed, deep learning has enabled many practical applications of machine learning and by extension in the overall field of AI. Deep Learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assistance seem possible. Driverless cars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon. AI is the present and the future. With deep learning’s help, AI may even get to that science fiction state we have for so long imagined.
<h2>Limits of artificial intelligence and machine learning: deep learning, neural networks, and cognitive computing</h2>
Of course, machine learning and artificial intelligence are not the only terms associated with this field of computer science. IBM often uses the term “cognitive computing”, which is a synonym with the term artificial intelligence.
But some other terms have a unique meaning. For example, artificial neural networks are a system designed to process information in ways similar to biological brainwork methods. Things can be confusing because neural networks tend to be particularly good at learning the machine, so these terms are sometimes confused.
In addition, neural networks provide the foundation for deep learning, a kind of machine learning. Deep learning uses a set of machine learning algorithms that work in multiple layers. This has been made possible, partly, by systems that use graphics processors to handle a large amount of data at the same time.
