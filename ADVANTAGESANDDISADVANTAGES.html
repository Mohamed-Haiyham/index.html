<h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
The benefits of artificial intelligence are incredible, what this area can offer us, is to evolve
definitively and move on to the history of artificial robots. Following are the main advantages
of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 Finished task faster than a human,
 Stressful and complex work completed easily,
 Difficult work done in short period,
 Various functions can done at a time,
 Success ratio is high,
 Less errors in task and defects also, 
<h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
Some of the main disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our daily lives are as
follows.
 Some time it can be misused leading to mass scale destruction,
 Programme mismatch sometime done opposite to the command,
 Human jobs affected,
 Unemployment problem increased,
 Creativity is depend upon programmer,
 Lacks the human touch,
 Younger generation becomes lazy
